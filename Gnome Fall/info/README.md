# Gnome Fall supporting files

The three files in the parent folder are the current production set: SVG transfer, guide PDF, and color-reference PDF. Select those when printing or sending the transfer to a supplier.

- assets/: canonical artwork, guide stages, masks and logo variants.
- tmp/: editable build sources, prompts, renders and verification records. Older dependencies are retained together to preserve provenance.
- output/: supporting exports, including matching PNGs and compatibility outline PDFs. Historical drafts may also be present; the parent folder is authoritative.
- test/ (when present): preserved supplied/test artwork.
- archive/previous-root-files/: previous root image aliases, original supplied images and old notes. These are retained unchanged, not current production choices.
- archive/build-caches/: old browser export profiles and package-download caches, preserved separately from working sources.
- organization-manifest.json: every moved file's original path, new path, size and SHA-256. All moved files were hash-verified.
- production-selection.json: selected source paths and hashes for the three promoted files.

Review: Portrait reference and guide rebuilt against existing SVG; see organization audit.

Active build/provenance: tmp/organization/ (see project organization-audit-gnomes.md for entrypoints).

Old instructions in preserved files describe the former layout. Old kit-relative assets/, tmp/, output/ and test/ paths now begin with info/. Old root image aliases live in archive/previous-root-files/. Builders that have not been adapted must have their paths reviewed before use; do not run old transfer exporters over the current 2-point gray SVG. Shared logo remains at project assets/images/river-and-ridge-logo.png. See the project canvas-kits.md and AGENTS.md for current instructions.


September 20 sky texture repair: current reference and guide use smooth-sky-source.png through the existing sky mask. The old integer-sampled sky is archived in info/archive/before-sky-smoothing/. See project reference-texture-review.md.

## Current guide template

The current guide uses the Fall View template, with logo and background accents matched to this painting. Shared builder: `assets/tools/guide-template/build.cjs` at the project root. Editable plan, HTML, logo prompt, layout checks and final verification: [tmp/template-refactor/](tmp/template-refactor/). Page-colored logo: [assets/template-refactor/river-and-ridge-logo.png](assets/template-refactor/river-and-ridge-logo.png). Earlier guide PDF/PNG: `archive/before-fall-view-template/`. Current artwork and transfer are unchanged.
